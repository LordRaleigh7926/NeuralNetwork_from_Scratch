## Introduction

This neural network implementation covers both forward and backward propagation steps. It allows for experimentation and customization of neural network components like activation functions, cost functions, and parameter updates.

## Installation

To run this project, you need Python 3.6 or higher. You can clone the repository and install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NeuralNetwork_from_Scratch.git
cd NeuralNetwork_from_Scratch
pip install numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. **Training the Neural Network**

   To train the neural network, you can use the `train` method of the `NeuralNetwork` class. Here's an example:

   ```python
   from NeuralNetwork import NeuralNetwork
   from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

   # Generate a binary classification dataset
   X, Y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=20, n_informative=2, n_redundant=10, random_state=42)

   # Normalize the features
   scaler = StandardScaler()
   X = scaler.fit_transform(X)

   # Split the dataset into training and testing sets
   X_train, X_test, Y_train, Y_test = train_test_split(X, Y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

   # Define the architecture of your neural network
   layer_dims = [X_train.shape[1], 100, 100, 1] # Input layer, hidden layer, and output layer
   activation = ['relu', 'relu', 'sigmoid'] # Activation functions for each layer
   metric = 'cross_entropy' # Loss function for binary classification

   # Initialize and train the neural network
   nn = NeuralNetwork(layer_dims, activation, metric)
   nn.train(X_train, Y_train.T, epoch=1000, alpha=0.01)
   ```

2. **Making Predictions**

   After training, you can use the `predict` method to make predictions on new data.

   ```python
   # Make predictions on the test set
   Y_pred = nn.predict(X_test)
   ```
